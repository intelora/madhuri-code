Product Enhancement is not just IT tool updating process, It require to update business process as well. Such as making improvements or modifications to current processes, formulating stages within processes using design models, update new production processes to develop manufacturing processes. Product Development comes from generating ideas for new products and researching feasibility in terms of profitability, resource availability and compliance with regulations. Hence recording and analysing data, presenting results to colleagues investigating and testing new equipment are equally important as liaising with engineering, research, technical and/or production staff understanding. Also update Product history log by writing technical papers, reports, reviews and specifications."

Our approach to QA testing needs to be adapted to the product that is being developed for Business Need. When developing the project we provide feature based testing like one thing at a time concept for parallel testing. InterOla ensure each test should focus on a feature or look at things like user interface or security. Our QA experts use Manual test, Automated Test, Integration test & regression tests. This help to update code quality for developers those can interfere with features that previously passed tests. IntelOra provide JIRA based Report and track bugs to determine, how bugs will be reported and what kind of data is needed. Apart from JIRA we choose bug tracking tool adapted to clientâ€™s workflow and determine which QA metrics will be tracked. Our Leverage analytics help to keep records of every test conducted and use this data to determine where bugs are likely to occur. This data reports will help developers to develop new tests that address problem areas. Environment for tests: IntelOra try covering a wide range of scenarios, including different devices, OS and user profiles along with unit and integration tests. Environmental tests will run isolate each env for your app. Our QA experts guide to developer to run unit tests in parallel to save time, be ensured that individual components work like they should."
