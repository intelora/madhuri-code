We have worked with 3D, Virtual and Slot integrated solution.<ul><li>Game Animation Solutions: IntelOra leverages popular gaming engines to model, texturize, skin, rig, render, and animate gaming assets and animation sensors model in AR view.</li><li>Motion Capture Software Programming: We program with full-motion video, motion capture, and PixiJS & Motion creator files for realistic game character animations, and develop motion gaming using gesture recognition, embedded sensors, and camera functions.</li><li>Display Analytics Integration: We integrate AR-VR based analytics to capture data and report for market data, visualization, and upcoming game character builder. It provides view information through the monitor and popular game logic algorithms including path finding and Artificial Intelligence (AI).</li><li>2D and 3D Implementation: We design and code custom 2D / 3D graphics and animations using pixijs, 2.5D isometric games, storylines, levels, characters, physics, logic, and sound effects. Our team developed program for audio and sound effects, including 3D positional sound, audio mixing, and digital signal processing.</li><li>Gaming Architecture for AR-VR: We design architecture solution to work with AR-VR based game to designs using LAN connectivity to supported devices as well as internet supported devices with low bandwidth.</li><li>Virtual Input Device: IntelOra develop AR based virtual input devices controller it use AI and Robotics to perform as controller for virtual hardware such as keyboards, controllers, joysticks, real-time motion control devices, and tools.</li><li>Multiplayer Video Game Development: IntelOra design synchronous/ asynchronous multiplayer games features for game state, spawning, scene management, debugging information, matchmaking, and customization. Our team develop porting services and translate source code for multiple platforms.</li><li>Random output but Profit Possibility Game Builder: the most importance feature build by robotics and AI to get user interaction and account behavior like bit, number or play etc. and apply random algorithm for profit possibility.</li></ul>"
