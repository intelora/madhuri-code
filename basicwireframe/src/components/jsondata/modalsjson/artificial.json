Porting is usually quicker and cheaper than performing a full code rewrite. However, manual porting can turn into a major code-rewrite if the underlying OS platforms are very different . Ideally, If you can re-use your existing code without to do any “porting” at all, then it’s all the more Existing code works and has been perfected in the field. Throwing it away and starting from scratch because of a change in environments is not sensible Porting is more effective and efficient if there is a lot of code"
