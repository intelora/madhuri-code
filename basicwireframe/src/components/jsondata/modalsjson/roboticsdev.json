Each and every food packet having different way, process, size, heat, volume, cover and quantity. JArduino work based on all these parameter to control packing adapter and give instruction for pressure, size, heat etc. We have used JArduino integrated hardware to play as adaptor responsibility and make decision about packing. JArudino logic also take care about material calculation based in history record."

The movement user select any product, he/she can scan and able to get offer/discount or price detail along with billing. It also maintains the COVID social distance, where user need not to touch any product and dhe can get the full defial by just scanner. At the movement when user exit form store, his smart cart auto send billing detail to cash counter to print receipt. Robotics based smart cart reduce long queue our sales ounter/billing counter and less human interaction during COVID-19 distance."
